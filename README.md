- [Lab 9](https://github.com/yourusername/cit281-lab9): Complete the GitHub Learning Lab "Create a release based workflow" course; practice working with course repos, navigating the course steps, and download the completed repo for submission.
  
## Projects
- [Project 1](https://github.com/yourusername/cit281-p1): Develop skills using the command line interface to create and list folders, use network commands, and write and run Node.js JavaScript code in VSCode.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/yourusername/cit281-p2): Gain experience using git through CLI and VSCode Source Control, write and run Node.js code, and practice refactoring JavaScript.
- [Project 3](https://github.com/yourusername/cit281-p3): Build a modular Node.js and Express project with modern JavaScript, handle JSON data, create RESTful routes, use .gitignore, and optionally test APIs with Postman.
- [Project 4](https://github.com/yourusername/cit281-p4): Build a Node.js REST API with Express, using GET routes and static data, modular code, modern JavaScript, and test APIs with Postman; extra credit for POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- [Project 5](https://github.com/yourusername/cit281-p5): Build a web-based game using classes, modules, and Node.js with AI elements; practice debugging and running a web server in VSCode.
- [Project 6](https://github.com/yourusername/cit281-p6): Create a client-server web app using Express with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE routes, and a server-side memory object as a pseudo-database; use AI assistance and GitHub for development.
- [Project 7](https://github.com/yourusername/cit281-p7): Build your initial CIT Minor portfolio using GitHub Pages. Create GitHub repos for each lab and project, enable GitHub Pages with a consistent theme, add descriptions and screen captures, and organize your work for easy access.
